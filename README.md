Overview of the Project-
Project-
C++ Program that act as a Suduko Solver

Objective
The primary objective of this Sudoku solver program is to automatically solve a given 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm. The program reads a predefined Sudoku grid, applies logical constraints to fill in the empty cells, and outputs the completed puzzle if a solution exists. If no solution can be found, it provides an appropriate message indicating that no solution exists.

Key Objective
- Automatic Puzzle Solving: Implement a backtracking algorithm to fill in a Sudoku grid where some cells are pre-filled, and others are empty.
- Output Formatting: Display the solved Sudoku grid in a readable format with clear separation between 3x3 subgrids.

File Handling
The current implementation does not involve file handling. The Sudoku grid is hardcoded into the program. For enhanced functionality, consider implementing file handling to:
- Load Sudoku Puzzles: Read Sudoku puzzles from an external file.
- Save Solutions: Write the solved Sudoku grid to a file.

  User Handling
  - Predefined Grid**: The Sudoku grid is predefined within the code and does not accept user input for grid values.
  - Potential User Interactions**: In a more advanced version, user interactions might include:
  - Inputting a Sudoku puzzle via the command line or a graphical user interface (GUI).
  - Receiving feedback or errors based on invalid inputs.

User Experience
- Output Presentation: The grid is printed in a well-formatted manner with visual separators for 3x3 subgrids, which improves readability.
- Solution Reporting: The program informs the user if a solution exists or if no solution can be found, making it clear whether the puzzle was successfully solved.

Input Validation
- Grid Validity: The program assumes that the initial grid is correctly formatted and adheres to Sudoku rules. It does not include additional input validation for checking grid correctness before solving.
- Number Placement: During the solving process, the algorithm ensures that numbers are placed according to Sudoku rules, i.e., no duplicate numbers in any row, column, or 3x3 subgrid.

Technologies Used
- Programming Language: C++
- Algorithm**: Backtracking algorithm for solving Sudoku puzzles.
- Standard Libraries: `iostream` for input/output operations.

   Potential Future Enhancements
   File Handling:
   - Read and Write: Add functions to read Sudoku puzzles from and write solutions to files.
   - File Format: Define a file format for representing Sudoku grids (e.g., CSV, JSON).

   User Interaction:
   - Command-Line Input: Allow users to input Sudoku puzzles directly from the command line or through a configuration file.
   - GUI Interface: Develop a graphical user interface for a more user-friendly experience.

   Error Handling:
   - Grid Validation: Implement checks for invalid initial grids or puzzles that cannot be solved due to conflicts.

   Performance Improvements:
   - Optimizations: Enhance the backtracking algorithm or use heuristics to solve larger or more complex Sudoku puzzles more efficiently.
